# Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that are included with Python and provide a wide range of functionalities
# These modules cover areas such as file I/O, data manipulation, networking, web development, regular expressions, math, dates and times, and more
# They allow you to perform various tasks without needing to write the code from scratch


# os and os.path: Operating system interfaces for tasks like file operations, directory manipulation, and environment variables
# sys: System-specific parameters and functions.
# math: Mathematical functions for basic and advanced mathematical operations.
# datetime and time: Date and time manipulation, formatting, and calculations.
# random: Generating random numbers and sequences.
# json: JSON encoding and decoding.
# csv: Reading and writing CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.
# socket: Low-level networking interfaces.
# urllib and urllib.request: Working with URLs, making HTTP requests, and fetching data from the web.
# http and http.server: Building simple HTTP servers and clients.


# The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing you to perform various tasks related to file and directory manipulation, environment variables, process management, and more
# It provides a consistent interface across different operating systems


# os.getcwd(): Get the current working directory
# os.chdir(path): Change the current working directory
# os.listdir(path): List the contents of a directory
# os.mkdir(path): Create a directory
# os.makedirs(path): Create directories recursively
# os.remove(path): Remove a file
# os.rmdir(path): Remove an empty directory
# os.rename(src, dst): Rename a file or directory
# os.path.join(path, *paths): Construct a path using the appropriate directory separator


# os.path.abspath(path): Get the absolute path of a file or directory
# os.path.exists(path): Check if a path exists
# os.path.isfile(path): Check if a path is a regular file
# os.path.isdir(path): Check if a path is a directory
# os.path.basename(path): Get the base name of a path
# os.path.dirname(path): Get the directory name of a path
# os.path.split(path): Split a path into directory and file parts


# os.system(command): Run a command in the system shell
# os.popen(command): Open a pipe to or from a command
